`fargo` is a CLI interface to Farcaster written in Go.

# Install
Clone the repo, and run `make bin`. Copy the generated binary `fargo` to a location in your `$PATH`.

# Use

```
fargo --help
```

The most interesting command is `fargo get`. 

Try `fargo get --help` or `fargo get @vrypan.eth/0x3e9f6825dc23a14efb4c5d71723f5bea2f89095f -e`.

The second one will also make you appreciate how much spam is suppressed by Warpcast.
